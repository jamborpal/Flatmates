# Flatmates

The need for this application arised from personal experience when living in flat/house with other students whom I have not met before. When entering to such living situation, there can be many things that have to be adjusted to accomodate everyone's needs and to be able to cooperate in an efficient way.

The issue of sharing tasks or expenses is something that is not often talked about, however the problem to manage said issues has arised in almost all student accomodations. Handling expenses and asking for money in order to be equal can be uncomfortable as well as asking tenants to do chores. This is sometimes a process which can lead to arguments. This is how the need for an application where flatmates can manage common issues regarding the apartment arised.

As far as the requirements of the application are concered, they have been MoSCoW prioritized and presented below. The actor is the flatmate using the app.
